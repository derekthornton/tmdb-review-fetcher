# TMDB Review Fetcher

TMDB Review Fetcher uses Kotlin with a Gradle interface to make calls to the TMDB API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3), and store/print the data. Its current functionality allows it to find and store movie reviews for hundreds to thousands of the most popular movies (which is not currently a service which TMDB currently offers without third-party implementation).
